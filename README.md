#Task 1: Creating a table

Create an HTML table that lists the details of the top 5 highest mountains in the world. The table should have the following columns:

Rank, Name, Height (in meters), Location, First Ascent

Here's the data that you should include in your table:

| Rank | Name | Height | Location | First Ascent |

|------|-------------------------|----------|----------------------|------------------|

| 1 | Mount Everest | 8848 | Nepal/China | 1953 |

| 2 | K2 | 8611 | Pakistan/China | 1954 |

| 3 | Kangchenjunga | 8586 | Nepal/India | 1955 |

| 4 | Lhotse | 8516 | Nepal/China | 1956 |

| 5 | Makalu | 8485 | Nepal/China | 1955 |

Your table should have a title and a caption. The title should be "Top 5 Highest Mountains in the World" and the caption should be "Data Source: Wikipedia".

Task 2: Adding images

Add an image to your table for each mountain. You can find images on the internet, or you can create your own images. The images should be displayed in the column next to the name of the mountain.

Task 3: Creating bookmark links

Create a navigation menu at the top of your page with the following links:

- Home

- Table of Contents

- Top 5 Highest Mountains in the World

When the user clicks on the "Table of Contents" link, they should be taken to a section of the page that lists all the headings and subheadings on the page. Each heading and subheading should be a clickable link that takes the user to that section of the page.

When the user clicks on the "Top 5 Highest Mountains in the World" link, they should be taken directly to the table you created in Task 1.
